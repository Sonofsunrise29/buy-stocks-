Buy stocks Up until recently, you could use companies that allowed you to buy a single share of stock to get your name on a corporate shareholder list, then enroll in closed direct stock purchase plans or dividend reinvestment plans that forbid outsiders who didn’t already own the stock. Unfortunately, in the financial industry’s decision to move away from paper stock certificates, this has become all but untenable. To take advantage of it, you’d need to pay a broker $250 or $500 in a so-called ’nuisance fee’ to issue the paper certificate. Instead, you’d be better off buying stock through a broker account and having it titled through the Direct Registration System. The problem is, you need a broker to do it. This is one of those areas where the wealthy have an advantage over everyone else. If a rich investor has a relationship with an asset management company, he or she could probably get the Registered Investment Advisor to have one of the firm’s institutional brokers place a trade on behalf of the client then transfer it as a gift to a child or family member through the DRS. The child or other recipient of the equity would now be able to buy stock without a broker in that particular business; granted access by those who could do it with ease.
